**Razers Duty & 911 Script** is a simple but powerful script that adds a clean on-duty system for LEOs, EMS, and other city departments ‚Äî plus a functional 911 call system that actually feels useful.

---

### üöì What It Does:

* Use `/duty LSPD` (or any department you set up) to go on/off duty
* Shows a live map blip to others on duty ‚Äî so you know who‚Äôs active
* Only players with proper ACE permissions (like `group.leo`) can use the command
* Sends Discord webhooks when players go on/off duty and tracks how long they were active

---

### üö® 911 Calls Made Useful:

* Players can do `/911 [message]` to alert emergency services
* Shows a blip on the map for 5 minutes at the caller‚Äôs location
* Sends a Mythic Notify alert to all on-duty players
* Caller gets a friendly ‚ÄúCall successful‚Äù message in chat

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Easy to Set Up:

* Works with OneSync
* No database needed
* Fully configurable departments
* Drop in, set your ACE perms, and go

the ace command is command.duty so for example you would put add_ace group.leo command.duty allow in your server.cfg
